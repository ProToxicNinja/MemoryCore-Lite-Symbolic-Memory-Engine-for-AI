# MemoryCore-Lite-Symbolic-Memory-Engine-for-AI

Symbolic memory compression, syncing, and lifelong learning for AI — lightweight, modular, and open.

MemoryCore Lite: Symbolic Memory Engine for AI
MemoryCore Lite is an open, lightweight symbolic memory system designed to compress, encode, sync, and evolve AI knowledge across devices.

Symbolic Encoding: Stores memories efficiently as lightweight bytecode.

P2P Synchronization: Share knowledge between nodes using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or mesh networking.

LLM Integration: Seamlessly extends and enhances existing language models.

Continuous Growth: Supports lifelong learning and decentralized memory expansion.

Ultra-Lightweight: Runs on low-end devices, edge devices, and experimental chips.

Open Architecture: Ready for experimentation, extension, and real-world deployment.

MemoryCore Lite forms the foundation of a distributed AI brain —
each node a neuron, each byte a thought.
