📚 MemoryCore Lite
MemoryCore Lite is a lightweight, symbolic memory compression engine.
It efficiently encodes and decodes text into compact symbolic bytecode using a custom tokenizer.
Designed for ultra-lightweight AI memory, offline knowledge storage, P2P syncing, and embedded devices.

🔥 Core Features
Encode text into symbolic memory

Decode symbolic memory back into readable text

Export compressed memories as pure bytecode

Ultra-lightweight (pure Python, no heavy dependencies)

Portable across devices (PC, tablet, embedded systems)

💡 Potential Use Cases

Area	How to Use MemoryCore Lite
🧠 AI Memory Modules	Add symbolic memory compression to LLMs, RL agents, or assistants
🛰️ Edge Devices	Run symbolic memory storage on microcontrollers, IoT devices, Raspberry Pi
🔒 Secure P2P Networks	Transmit compressed symbolic knowledge instead of raw text
🤖 Lightweight Robotics	Give small robots or drones persistent memory without heavy compute cost
🕸️ Mesh Networks	Symbolic knowledge sharing across offline or local mesh systems
🧩 Foundation for Neurochains	Build distributed symbolic "neural" networks (future-ready!)
📚 Archival Storage	Save decades of knowledge in tiny encoded files for recovery or offline use
✨ Why Symbolic Memory?
Symbolic encoding dramatically shrinks textual data while preserving meaning —
allowing lightweight, persistent, decentralized AI memory across machines, devices, and even future networks.

MemoryCore Lite is the first step toward true decentralized cognition.

Technical Details

MemoryCore-Lite symbolically encodes memories using:

A trained SentencePiece model (64k vocab).

Encodes token IDs into compact bytecode.

Fully reversible decoding back to text (non-random, deterministic).


Unlike embeddings, MemoryCore preserves symbolic structure:

Allows merging, deduplication, and symbolic syncing across nodes.

Lightweight and human-readable when decoded.

Designed for decentralized, evolving AI memory systems not just compression.

Vision

The goal of MemoryCore-Lite is not just to compress data
it's to create a foundation for symbolic peer-to-peer memory sharing.

Imagine:

Distributed AIs syncing experiences without heavy GPUs.

Low-cost edge devices sharing symbolic memories across local or mesh networks.

A decentralized "hive mind" made from lightweight, symbolic cognition.


MemoryCore is intended as a starting point a simple, open engine for evolving AI memory structures.

I'm not a professional developer.
I'm just someone deeply curious about AI memory and wanted to contribute a building block.
